</p>
                                 <p class="p List2">(3) Encouraging a contractor to incur costs under a cost-reimbursable contract in excess of those costs contractually allowable; and
</p>
                                 <p class="p List2">(4) Committing the Government to a course of action with regard to a potential contract, contract change, claim, or dispute.</p>
