                                 <p class="p List2">(4) Applicable special provisions;

The contractor's cost proposal for each task order must be fully supported by cost and pricing data adequate to establish the reasonableness of the proposed amounts. When the contractor's estimated cost for the proposed task order exceeds $100,000 and the period of performance exceeds six months, the contractor may be required to submit a Contractor Spending Plan (CSP) as part of its cost proposal. The TORP indicates if a CSP is required.
