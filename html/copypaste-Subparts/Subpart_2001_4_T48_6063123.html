         <p class="p List1">(a) Deviations from the provisions of the FAR or NRCAR may be granted as specified in this subpart when necessary to meet the specific needs of the requesting office.

         <p class="p List1">(b) Requests for authority to deviate from the provisions of the FAR or the NRCAR must be signed by the requesting office and submitted to the Director, Division of Contracts and Property Management, in writing, as far in advance as possible. Each request for deviation must contain the following:
</p>
         <p class="p List2">(1) A statement of the deviation desired, including identification of the specific paragraph number(s) of the FAR or NRCAR from which a deviation is requested;
</p>
         <p class="p List2">(2) The reason why the deviation is considered necessary or would be in the best interest of the Government;
</p>
         <p class="p List2">(3) If applicable, the name of the contractor and identification of the contract affected;
</p>
         <p class="p List2">(4) A description of the intended effect of the deviation;
</p>
         <p class="p List2">(5) A statement of the period of time for which the deviation is needed; and
