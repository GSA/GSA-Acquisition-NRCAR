         <p class="p List2">(2) Furnishing Government property is likely to result in substantially lower costs to the Government for the items produced or services rendered when all costs involved (e.g., transportation, installation, modification, maintenance, etc.) are compared with the costs to the Government of the contractor's use of privately-owned property; and
</p>
         <p class="p List2">(3) The Government receives adequate consideration for providing the property.
